# Deli-cious
This project is the point of sales application for DELI-cious, a custom sandwich
shop. Currently at DELI-cious our customers can fully customize their sandwich
orders. Until recently we have been managing all orders in person and are
currently taking all orders on paper. But our business is growing, and we need a
way to automate the order process (and eventually even make it available
online).
This application takes full advantage of Object Oriented Analysis and
Design Create classes and interfaces as necessary to build this solution.
